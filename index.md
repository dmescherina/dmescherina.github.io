Everyone had to use a linear regression at one point or another during their work- (or even life-) time, mostly probably in the context of Statistics syllabus in University. But what if you could make this mundane tool much more exciting and efficient? Below are the list of things that Data Scientists put on top of the Ordinary Least Squares to make it a bit more extraordinary

1. Variables (features) selection
⋅⋅⋅If you get some data set from the real world to analyse then it would probably have a few variables that would be correlated between each other. Or a few too many variables in total, most of which might not add a tremendous amount of explanatory power to your model. One of the ways to deal with it is to choose a subset of the variables (aka features)⋅⋅
